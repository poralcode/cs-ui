# User Roles and Activities | Documentation

This document provides an overview of the user roles and activities within the system.

### Faculty: 
Faculty members are required to register in order to manage studentsâ€™ research papers. Their responsibilities include approving or declining papers submitted by students. For simplicity, we will assume that all students and faculty belong to a single department.

- Manage Papers: After signing in, faculty members are directed to their respective dashboards. Here, they can view a list of papers awaiting their approval, as well as those they have already approved or declined. They can manage these papers by selecting them and performing the appropriate action as needed.

- Search Papers: Faculty members are not limited to reviewing papers; they also have the ability to search for and browse any approved paper on the browsing page.
