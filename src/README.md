# User Roles and Activities | Documentation

This document provides an overview of the user roles and activities within the system.

### Faculty: 
Faculty members are required to register in order to manage studentsâ€™ research papers. Their responsibilities include approving or declining papers submitted by students. For simplicity, we will assume that all students and faculty belong to a single department.

- **Manage Papers**: After signing in, faculty members are directed to their respective dashboards. Here, they can view a list of papers awaiting their approval, as well as those they have already approved or declined. They can manage these papers by selecting them and performing the appropriate action as needed.

- **Search Papers**: Faculty members are not limited to reviewing papers; they also have the ability to search for and browse any approved paper on the browsing page.

### Student:
Students must register to submit and manage their research papers, seeking approval to verify the legitimacy of their work.

- **Manage Papers**: Upon signing in, students can upload their research paper in PDF format, provide necessary details related to the citation, and save their submission. They must then wait for faculty approval. Once a paper has been reviewed and approved by the faculty, it becomes publicly available for browsing.

- **Search Papers**: Students are not restricted to submitting their research papers; they can also search for and browse any approved paper on the browsing page.
